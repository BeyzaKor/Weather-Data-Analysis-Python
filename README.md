## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the full analysis and code for a weather data midterm assignment. The objective was to load, explore, clean, and visualize Irish weather data for 2018–2019, focusing on temperature, rainfall, wind, and sunshine patterns.

The assignment involved:
- Data cleaning and temporal analysis
- Handling missing data
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Comparative analysis across Dublin, Shannon, and Cork Airports

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Midterm_Assignment_Beyza_Kordan.pdf` – Full assignment write-up with visualizations and interpretations.
- `scripts/weather_analysis.py` – All Python code used in the assignment.
- `notebooks/midterm_analysis.ipynb` – Optional: interactive Jupyter notebook version of the code.
- `data/weather_1819.csv` – Raw weather dataset (if distributable).

## 📊 Key Techniques Used

- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data analysis and visualization
- Time series and summary statistics
- Missing data treatment strategies
- Scatter plots, box plots, histograms
- Station-level comparison (Dublin, Shannon, Cork)

## 💡 Highlights
